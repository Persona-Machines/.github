  <h1>Privacy. Control. Value.</h1>
  <p><strong>The Missing Layer of the Internet Economy</strong></p>
</div>

The digital economy is shifting. Tracking is breaking down, regulations are tightening, and trust is collapsing. What comes next isn’t another patchwork of cookies or consent banners — it’s a new foundation. Persona Machines builds the infrastructure for this future: one where people control what they reveal, advertisers get real signals, and value is shared instead of extracted.

## Why It Matters

When every party **wins**, the ecosystem becomes **stronger** — and more **sustainable**.

## The Mission Behind the Machine

### The Shift

For twenty years, the internet economy was powered by surveillance. Platforms collected, tracked, and resold personal data to fuel ads. That era is ending.

- **Users demand control.**
- **Advertisers demand efficiency.**
- **Regulators demand transparency.**

Persona Machines is leading this transition. The next internet will not be built on spying. It will be built on consent, cohorts, and trust.

### Our Mission

We believe privacy should not be a tax on innovation. It should be an engine of growth. Our mission is to give:

- **Users** ➝ awareness, protection, and influence over how their data is used.
- **Advertisers** ➝ performance without compromise, powered by high-quality, consent-driven signals.
- **Regulators** ➝ transparency and compliance built into the architecture itself.

When privacy, performance, and trust align, everyone wins.

### About Us

Persona Machines is a team of researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs from Carnegie Mellon University and other top institutes. Our backgrounds span foundational AI research, trust and user experience at Microsoft, ads platforms like Bing and Google Ads, and product development in both startups and incubators.

We bring this mix of research insight and product execution to build a privacy-first infrastructure for the AI era — the missing layer of the internet — where privacy, personalization, and value finally align.
